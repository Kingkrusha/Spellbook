Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.\n\nAnything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.\n\nNot every singer or poet in a tavern or royal court is a Bard. Harnessing the Words of Creation requires hard work and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. A Bard's survey of the multiverse might begin during childhood, when stories and songs helped them understand things their elders couldn't quite explain. As they age, some Bards might learn under musicians and storytellers at local taverns and fairs, while others might attend a university devoted to a bardic tradition.",

Charm Person, Color Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Bard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.\n\n*Changing Your Prepared Spells.* Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.\n\n*Spellcasting Ability.* Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.\n\n*Spellcasting Focus.* You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.",

Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.\n\nNot every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic.

Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.\n\nMonks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.\n\nMany Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.\n\nMonks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.",

Whether sworn before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.\n\nPaladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.\n\nAlmost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the world's armies, but even fewer can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.",

The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Mind Sliver and Minor Illusion are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except Mage Hand, with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\n\n*Spell Slots.* The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\n*Prepared Spells of Level 1+.* You prepare a list of the level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. Charm Person, Disguise Self and Fog Cloud are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n*Changing Your Prepared Spells.* Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.\n\n*Spellcasting Ability.* Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\n\n*Spellcasting Focus.* You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.",

Some Sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby's birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.\n\nSorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.\n\nSorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn't like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded.",

Many travel between cosmopolitan settlements, such as those along the Sword Coast, and wield their magic in service of the common good. Others realize their own strange powers by roaming equally strange lands, from the magic-blasted wastes of the desert of Anauroch to the god-touched wilds of the Old Empires. Wherever they go in the Realms, spellfire Sorcerers are courted by factions with interests in the arcane arts, such as the Harpers, Cult of the Dragon, and Red Wizards.",

They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.\n\nWarlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.\n\nOnce a pact is made, a Warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.",

      "description": "Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic's inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.\n\nMost Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.\n\nThe closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.\n\nBut the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.",

It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.\n\nThe book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\n\n*Spell Slots.* The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\n*Prepared Spells of Level 1+.* You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nIf another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.\n\n*Changing Your Prepared Spells.* Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\n\n*Spellcasting Ability.* Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\n\n*Spellcasting Focus.* You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.",

Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried start burning.\n\n*Force Ballista:* Make a ranged spell attack originating from the cannon at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 Force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.\n\n*Protector:* The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).",

You can use Thieves' Tools, Tinker's Tools, or another kind of Artisan's Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an M component when you cast it).\n\n*Cantrips.* You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice. When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.\n\n*Spell Slots.* The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\n*Prepared Spells of Level 1+.* You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nIf another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.\n\n*Changing Your Prepared Spells.* Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.\n\n*Spellcasting Ability.* Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.",

Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.\n\nIf a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it.

Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.\n\nYou can't have more magic items from this feature than the number shown in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table for your level. If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.\n\n*Duration.* A magic item created by this feature functions as the normal magic item, except its magic isn't permanent; when you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.\n\n*Spellcasting Focus.* You can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan's Tools.",
